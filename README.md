[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AtomHash/evernode.svg?branch=dev-1.0.0)](https://travis-ci.org/AtomHash/evernode) [![Pypi Package](https://badge.fury.io/py/evernode.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/evernode) [![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/evernode/badge/)](http://evernode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

EverNode for fast beautiful APIs
---
EverNode adds enhanced features to [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) out of the box for rapid API development. Support for [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy) model serialization, internationalization, easy to handle form data, JWT Bearer Authorization, authorized emails and more. Our primary focus for EverNode is modular based API development and to remain as light weight and fast as possible.

Fair Warning
---
EverNode is currently developed in my spare time and used in my personal applications used in a production environment.
So any features that I deem useful get added to EverNode without much notice, while also trying to keep bulk down.
This warning is to warn people that I do not plan on having stable release timeframes until EverNode v2.
At that time a new release schedule will be created, along with much, much better unit tests. Thanks
