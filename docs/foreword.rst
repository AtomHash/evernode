Foreword
========

Read this before you get started with EverNode. This will hopefully answer some
questions about the purpose and goals of the project, and when you
should or should not be using it.

What is EverNode?
-----------------------

EverNode is a micro Application Programming Interface framework for flask.
It adds features to flask to make API development a breeze. EverNode does not
modify flask directly, but just adds nice features to help build API's faster. EverNode is built with
stateless data transfer in mind and does not use sessions. Security is also a top concern
and EverNode is also improving security to help keep your application secure. 

Highlights of the project include:

* Modular Design
* Sateless Data Transfer
* Easy Authentication with JWT tokens
* RESTful approach
* JSON first approach
* Easy Internationalization with Language Packs
* CORs support
* And much more
