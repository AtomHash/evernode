Foreword
========

Read this before you get started with EverNode. This will hopefully answer some
questions about the purpose and goals of the project, and when you
should or should not be using it.

What is EverNode?
-----------------------

EverNode adds features to `Flask <https://github.com/pallets/flask>`_ to make API development easier. EverNode does not
modify Flask directly, but just adds nice features to help build APIs faster. EverNode is built with
stateless data transfer in mind and does not use sessions.

Highlights of the project include:

* Modular Design
* Sateless Data Transfer
* Easy Authentication with JWT tokens
* RESTful approach
* JSON first approach
* Easy Internationalization with Language Packs
* CORs support
* And much more
